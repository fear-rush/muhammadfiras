Wednesday, 29 January 2025. I'm writing this at 23.23, in the middle of the night, while listening to Sweet Dreams - The Last Shadow Puppets.

I got this idea to write last month when I was scrolling TikTok (the most valid source btw) and then
I saw an illustration image that had a devil and some text on it. The sentence was like this:

> "If you can't get angry because you understand how everyone feels, it's both a good and bad thing.
> The good thing is you understand why people do what they do. but, the bad thing is, because you understand
> why they did it, you can't express your own feelings."

and I've been thinking about it ever since.
